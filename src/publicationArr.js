    abstract:
      "Current collapse is a phenomenon that increases the channel resistance during the switching process when the high gate and drain voltages are applied. The effect can be found from GaN-based high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) and is an obstacle for their applications to power electronics. There have been numerous reports on suppressing current collapse using semiconductor process technologies. In this paper, an enhancement mode (E-mode) AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN double heterostructure was proposed. The current collapse phenomena were studied on devices of E-mode MIS and Schottky gate HEMTs. The results indicate the suppression of current collapse for devices with double heterostructure.",

    abstract: `The applications of gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs) have become more and more important in recent years. Due to the outstanding material properties including wide-band-gap and high electron mobility, GaN HEMTs are widely applied to high voltage electronics and high efficiency power conversion systems. The two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formed in heterojunction ensures the large operating output current and low on-resistance of the device. However, the leakage current and current collapse phenomenon concerning to the material defects reduce the power conversion efficiency of the device in high speed switching. In this research, enhancement-mode (E-mode) AlGaN/GaN HEMTs are demonstrated; the electrical characteristics and dynamic characteristics are also investigated.
In this thesis, dynamic output characteristics are analyzed between the conventional p-GaN HEMT and the HEMT with plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) SiO2 as the passivation. The current collapse can be suppressed effectively in E-mode HEMT with SiO2 due to the extra electron-accumulating space created by passivation. Electrons that used to accumulate in p-GaN capping layer and deplete 2DEG carriers can be neutralized by electron-accumulating space formed in SiO2.
In order to construct metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS)-HEMTs with optimized performance, high quality of layer interface is the critical factor of current collapse suppression and gate leakage minimization. We propose surface treatments including fluorine plasma, argon plasma and nitrogen plasma to improve interface quality.
Based on our previous experience of developing AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, we construct MIS structures with atomic layer deposition (ALD) Al2O3. The Al2O3 can passivate the surface defects formed by plasma bombardment and suppress current collapse in long pulse mode. Also, we investigate the impact of epi structures on electrical characteristics and the phenomenon of current collapse. The power conversion efficiency in p-GaN MIS-HEMTs can be effectively improved by double heterostructure.`,

    abstract:
      "Current collapse will cause electrically recession such as reducing the output current density and increasing the dynamic on-resistance. The phenomenon becomes more serious when the device is under high operating voltage and high switching speed. In order to investigate the phenomenon of current collapse, the dynamic output characteristics of the p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN enhancement-mode high electron mobility transistors (E-mode HEMTs) were demonstrated. In this paper, devices with and without SiO 2 passivation layer were tested. Two types of p-GaN HEMTs were fabricated simultaneously except for the passivation process. Normalized R on at different gate stress biases were extracted to numerically express the current collapse phenomenon. The results indicate that the devices with SiO 2 passivation can effectively suppress the phenomenon of current collapse within the gate bias of -15V. We suggest that the effect of SiO 2 passivation is beneficial for suppressing current collapse in E-mode device.",

    abstract:
      "The phenomenon of current collapse was investigated on p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN enhancement-mode high electron mobility transistors. Contrary to our original thought of carrier depletion on the p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN layers so that less carrier traps, current collapse was observed from such a device without surface passivation. The results were compared with the device passivated with SiO 2 dielectric, which showed much less severe current collapse within the gate bias of -15 V. To understand the mechanism of dielectric passivation, the capacitance-voltage measurement was performed. Our results show that the donor-like dislocations in the SiO 2 /GaN interface help to deplete carriers on the device surface and within the p-GaN, thus maintaining channel carriers and mitigating current collapse.",
